# Todoapp 2: Done With Angular and <3 

This is a todoapp like the one i have did with AngularJS; but since that was a mess, i have decided to create a more stable one, with the most recent version of the framework which in the end works really great until now.



V 0.2: Insert with Components.

V 1.1: Set basic functionality.

V 1.0: Set the basis for the app.
